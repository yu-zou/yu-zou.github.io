<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I'm Yu Zou (ÈÇπÂÆá in Chinese). I work at ByteDance as a system security research engineer.
Before joining ByteDance, I worked as a research scientist
at Alibaba DAMO Academy.
I got my Ph.D. degree at the University of Central Florida, master degree at the University of Florida,
and bachelor degree at the Beihang University.

My research interests encompass
**1) high-performance, energy-efficient, and confidential
heterogeneous
computing; 2) secure computer architecture; 3) hardware security attack and defense; 4) trustworthy computer system; 5) AI for hardware; and 6) hardware for AI.**
I am highly enthusiastic about exploring innovative system
designs that are feasible and robust enough
to address urgent industrial challenges, thereby contributing to the solution of real industry
technical issues.
Additionally, I am an ardent advocate of automating everything.
Anything that necessitates the involvement of repetitive human resources is a potential candidate
for optimization though automation.
I'm also a strong proponent of open-sourcing. Open-sourcing is not merely a community behavior;
it is also a form of self-regulation that demands everything to
be perfected to the extent that
it can be made accessible to the public.

For more details about me, please check out my
[CV](../assets/YuZou_Academic_CV_20250224.pdf) and

- _2025.05_: &nbsp;üéâ
Will give a talk at Institute of Information Engineering,
Chinese Academy of Science. I'll talk about building a trustworthy and
high-performance heterogeneous system. Thanks for Prof. Rui Hou's
invitation.

- _2024.10_: &nbsp;üéâ
One of our papers was accepted and will be presented at ASPLOS'25.
It proposes an innovative trusted execution environment (TEE) on COTS FPGAs.
A collaboration work between Alibaba DAMO Academy and Tsinghua University.
